OG Views
======================

Module provides a field that allows you to display a view of group content 
inside the group entity. The field can be added to group entities and it 
provides a drop down selector to choose which view to use. Be sure to visit 
the Display Fields page after adding it to the group node and choose the 
display format of 'Group View'.

The rest of OG's views integration is inside OG core itself, so you 
probably don't need to install this module, unless you want the 
Views field functionality.

This is being ported for sites that used it to have an easier migration to
Backdrop. 99% will not need or want this module!
